In this study, I aim to employ the [HMEQ dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajay1735/hmeq-data/data) to develop a predictive model that distinguishes customers likely to default on their loans from those expected to successfully repay their loans. In the scope of this project, I explore strategies for handling imbalanced data, evaluating the effectiveness of specific algorithms chosen from a predefined subset, and identifying the most influential features for predictive accuracy.
