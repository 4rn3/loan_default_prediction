Utilizing the [HMEQ dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajay1735/hmeq-data/data), this project aims to predict which borrowers are more likely to default on their loans. The dataset provides a solid base for analyzing patterns in home equity loan repayments.

The goal of this project is to compare a set of machine learning models on the task of loan default prediction. The comparison consists of several aspects, since in a real-life scenario just comparing accuracy alone is not enough. I will focus on the false negative metric since it's arguably worse for a bank to give someone a loan that is likely to default rather than decline a loan to someone who would pay it back. To comply with regulations of automated decision-making for AI, the models will also need to be interpretable enough to demonstrate why a potential client has declined a loan.<br>
